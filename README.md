# Managed Method FE Code Challenge (Windy Weather APP)

```text
For this challenge, we would like you to build a Weather Application using React to show off your style and skill as a developer! Below is the criteria.
```

1. We are providing no boilerplate, we want to see how you go about creating a React application from scratch, so feel free to initate your project however you normally would.
2. Your Weather Application must be written using React exclusively.
3. We would also like you to use Redux for all state management.
4. We would also like you to use the Weather Undeground API for this project, which can be found here ...
   https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/
5. Your weather application should include at least two main features. The first, is a display of cards which represents the 10 DAY FORECAST for any given location. This 10 DAY FORECAST must include the WIND forecast!!!
6. The second feature which must be included, is a Search bar, which allows us to pass a location as a parameter which is then sent to the WUNDERGROUND API, this way your application can display the 10 day forecast for any location speifcied by the user.
7. Please include any other features which you find fun or cool. Adding dynamic icons for rain, sun, snow, wind which are rendered relative to the daily forecast for instance will help you stand out as a candidate. The more creative you get with adding bells and whistles the more likely we are to notice you.
8. However, also make sure to submit a completed bug free application which has been well tested. Make sure to remove any commented out code, console logs, etc... Please submit clean and well written code.
9. Please write at least 3 tests.
10. Bonus points if you find a reason to integrate charts and graphs.
11. Bonus points if you send us a link to a deployed instance of your app (github pages, heroku, firebase, etc...)
12. Include a README.md with your submission which tells us how to run your application, do not forget to include instrucions pertaining to the Weather Undeground API and its permissions. In this README also tell us how to run your test suite.
13. Lastly, Create a zip folder with your project and send it over to davery@managedmethods.com!
14. Please submit your project within 7 days of receiving this challenge.
